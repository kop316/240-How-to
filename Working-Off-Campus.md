You need to be on a CMU network to access the ECE servers. This means, if you want to submit your work, edit code on the servers, compile using VCS, or a number of useful things, you need to either be on campus, connected to the campus network somehow. There are two main methods of doing this. One using the Cisco AnyConnect VPN. This is a VPN provided by CMU. 

Note that the Campus VPN only redirects `cmu.edu` domain traffic over the VPN, and the Full VPN directs all of your traffic over the VPN.

You can download it here: https://www.cmu.edu/computing/software/all/cisco-anyconnect/
