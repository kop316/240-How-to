EDAPlayground is a very convenient alternative to code sharing applications such as VSCode Live Share or copy paste code sharing. It supports synchronous editing from multiple users, similar to websites like Google Drive or Repl.it.

* To create an account: https://www.edaplayground.com/login
  * Use your school email address for account creation in order to use the VCS simulator, which is the same simulator used on the ECE servers.
  * Once you have registered and verified your account, you will see this window:

* To enable synchronous code editing with other users, click the `collaborate` button. 
  * You will then be presented with a link on the right hand side of your window. 
  * Any user that joins this link can edit the code in real time, but in order for them to run or save the code, they must log into their account.

* To save your work, you can click the `save` button on the top of the site. This will only save it remotely to the EDA playground site. 
  * To download the files, check the `downloading files after run` on the left hand side of the site. 
  * Then run your program, which you can do by clicking the `run` button on the top of the screen.
