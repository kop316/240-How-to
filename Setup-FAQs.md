#### When is the last time I can submit an assignment?
Read the homework handout for the deadline. Attempts to run `handin240` for
overdue assignments will *not* work, as we do not accept late work.

Please *please* **please** leave ample time before the deadline to submit. We
are not responsible for your inability to plan accordingly.
