Stormchaser is the name of the daughter board that sits on top of the DE0-CV FPGA board.  
In many instances, we just refer to the combination of both as "the board".

Here's a picture with many useful notes.  Keep track of which way stuff is numbered, as it isn't consistent (i.e. the highest numbered switch is not always on the left).
