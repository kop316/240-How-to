Over the course of the semester, you may find that we've made a mistake in our
grading either for your assignments or exams. We're human. It happens. Should
you notice a mistake in the way your work was graded, please follow the
following instructions. Note that the process differs between normal work and
exams.

Do note that *there is no penalty to your score* when submitting regrade
requests. Even if we notice a mistake that would cause you to lose points we
will not deduct them. The worst outcome for you when filing a regrade request is
you don't gain any points, so *please* tell us if we make a mistake.

## All assignments (HW, lab, exams)
Please submit regrade requests via Gradescope. If regrades are not opened,
please let us know via Piazza.

A TA will reply to your post and notify you of the outcome. Please submit
your regrade requests within a week after grades have been released.
