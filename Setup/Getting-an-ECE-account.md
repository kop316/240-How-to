In order to make use of the tools for this class, you will need an ECE account.
Note that *this is separate from your Andrew account*. You can check to see if
you have an account by trying to SSH into an ECE machine (if you're confused on
how to do that, see [this page](Creating-SSH-shortcuts)).

Otherwise, you may reset your ECE password by following the directions here:
https://userguide.its.cit.cmu.edu/services/accounts-services/changing-ece-account-passwords/

If there is a problem, I would recommend contacting IT at
[help@ece.cmu.edu](mailto:help@ece.cmu.edu) to ask for an account.

**YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO MOST OF THE COURSE WORK UNTIL YOU HAVE AN ECE
ACCOUNT.** So please ensure you have one ASAP.
